# e-commerce-backend



This project uses sequelize and express to create the backend for a potential e-commerce application. This uses 4 data models: Tag, Product, Category, and ProductTag to create basic functionality to create products which have a price, stock, category, and a possible number of tags to differentiate it.

## Installation Instructions <a name="installation"></a>
Clone the git repository and install the dependencies using ```npm install```. Then create and seed the database with  db/schema.sql and seeds/index.js. Finally run server.js to start listening for requests. Use API clients like Insomnia or Postman to submit requests to the server.


## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This backend project includes routes that listen for requests on ```the localhost:3001/api/*``` path. CRUD operations on the Product, Category, and Tag models can be done through the 
```api/products/``` , ```api/categories/```, and ```api/tags/``` respectively
