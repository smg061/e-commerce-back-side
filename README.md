# e-commerce-backend



This project uses sequelize and express to create the backend for a potential e-commerce application. This uses 4 data models: Tag, Product, Category, and ProductTag to create basic functionality to create products which have a price, stock, category, and a possible number of tags to differentiate it.

## Installation Instructions <a name="installation"></a>
Clone the git repository and install the dependencies using ```npm install```. Then create and seed the database with  db/schema.sql and seeds/index.js. Finally run server.js to start listening for requests. Use API clients like Insomnia or Postman to submit requests to the server.

This backend project includes routes that listen for requests on the localhost:3001/api/* path. CRUD operations on the Product, Category, and Tag models can be done through the 
```api/products/``` , ```api/categories/```, and ```api/tags/``` respectively
